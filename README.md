# Spring Plumbing Project
A playground for testing Spring Dependency Injection (DI) / adding Beans to the Spring Context using different methods. Most of the DI has been done within `Application.java`.

### DI has been achieved via:

* Field injection
* Configuration class
* Services
* Services in external packages
* Setter injection
